# Multi-Label-Online-Toxic-Comment-Classification

In this project, we used a state-of-the-art model, BERT, along with neural networks and LSTM to classify abusive comments with respect to 4 catogories. The results and source codes are shown here, along with a paper that we wrote, which describes more detailed motivation, data processing, models, and findings.
